....

== Fixed Issues

* When a cluster failed to restart for any reason, the Go client failed to reconnect to it even after the cluster successfully restarted. We've now added support for the Go client to asynchronously reconnect to a cluster.
(https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/145)
* Disable Phone Home for MC and HZ when Operator Phone Home is disabled.
(https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-platform-operator/pull/150)
* Changes readiness probe of Management Center into `TCPSocket` for port `8080` to prove the Spring Web which is main process for Management Center started properly.
